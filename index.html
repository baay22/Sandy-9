                <h4>How To Get Rid of A Double Chin</h4>
                <h3>How Does Morpheus8® Work?</h3>
                <p>As time passes on, aging and weight gain causes the loosening of skin. What was once firm and smooth could gradually turn loose and saggy if you don’t stop it in its tracks. When healthy eating and regular exercise just won’t cut it, <a href="https://www.burlingtonmedicalaesthetics.com/treatments/skin-tightening-radiesse-morpheus/skin-tightening-morpheus8/">Morpheus8®</a> steps in to save your skin.</p>
                <p>Excessive fat build-up can lead to sagging skin in multiple parts of the body. In an effort to eliminate this beauty concern, Morpheus8® was born. Morpheus8® is a non-invasive and non-surgical cosmetic procedure that harnesses the power of radiofrequency in order to stimulate collagen production. This process tightens the skin’s texture while minimizing the appearance of wrinkles on both the face and body.</p>
                <p>The treatment works by penetrating the subdermal levels of the tissues by means of microneedles. The tips of these tiny needles heat the tissues and under skin fat by means of radiofrequency causing fat coagulation which in turn promotes the production of neo collagen (new collagen). It is the only beauty solution that can Mould fat under the skin to provide optimal results through contouring and refining subcutaneous layers. As a result, patients can experience sculpted skin in the most natural way possible.</p>
                <h5>Who Can Benefit from Morpheus8® Double Chin Removal Treatment?</h5>
                <p>A double chin is submental fat that appears when a layer of fat accumulates under your chin or the submentum area. This condition is often associated with weight gain, aging, genetics, or bad posture.</p>
                <p>Naturally, if you put on a few pounds, it would most likely reflect on your neck and chin area, as these parts of the body are prone to excess fat build-up. When it comes to aging, no one is truly safe from the effects of collagen loss, which could easily result in a double chin. Bad posture is often the culprit too; if you slouch over your desk to stare at your laptop screen or bend your neck often to scroll on your phone, the odds are that a double chin will start creeping up on you.</p>
                <p>Morpheus8® is a safe, non-invasive and effective treatment option for double chin and face slimming.</p>

                <h6>1. Double Chin</h6>
                <p>In addition to firming mildly lax skin, Morpheus8 can melt fat cells under your chin (submental fat) without the need for surgery. The heat source used in the treatment works to liquefy fat cells, reducing the number of fat cells that make up a “double chin.” This combined effect of Morpheus8’s skin tightening and adipose tissue remodeling contours the jawline and chin area for a more sculpted look.</p>
                <p>You can choose to combine your Morpheus8 procedure with <a href="https://sandykeymedical.com/skin-treatments/">dermal filler</a> for the lips or under the eyes for additional facial rejuvenation. Make sure to talk to your plastic surgeon to see if you are a good candidate for combining Morpheus8 with other cosmetic procedures.</p>
                <h6>2. Wrinkles & Fine Lines</h6>
          
                <p>Men and women of all ages can use Morpheus8 to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles. You may have tried treatments such as chemical peels to improve these skin issues, but Morphes8 and its use of radiofrequency allow the treatment to penetrate deeper into the skin’s layers.</p>
                <p>Deeper penetration into the skin can translate to more dramatic results with fewer sessions than conventional skin treatments that address only the upper layers of the skin.</p>

               <h6>3. Sagging Skin</h6>
               <p>When your skin elasticity diminishes with age, it can lead to the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, and poor skin texture. Morpheus8 mildly lifts and tightens sagging skin with its combination of microneedling and RF energy to stimulate collagen and elastin production. Additionally, since RF energy penetrates deeper into the layers of the skin, it can contract the skin more effectively, as well as increase skin cell turnover.</p>
               <h6>4. Acne Scars</h6>
               <p>Morphus8 treatments can help men and women embarrassed by acne scars improve their skin concerns. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4134659/">study</a> published in the <i>Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery</i> found that about 80% of people with grade 3 and 4 acne scars reduced their scarring by 2 grades after RF microneedling.</p>
               <p>Morpheus8 RF is a versatile treatment, and it’s safe for even deeper skin types with little risk of hyperpigmentation. Your provider can determine if you are a good candidate for this treatment and talk with you about the type of results you might expect.</p>
               <p><b>Does Morpheus 8 get rid of double chin?</b></p>
               <p>Morpheus8 and Fractora™ are two aesthetic treatments that are known for their skin-regeneration and youth-enhancing abilities, that <b>can also help to eliminate the appearance of excess fat under the chin.</b></p>

               <p><b>Morpheus8 Hand Rejuvenation</b></p>
